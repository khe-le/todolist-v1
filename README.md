ToDo List
This ToDo List is a small project I made during my web development journey, using EJS, Node, and Express.

## Installation & Set Up

<h3>Install Node.js</h3>


1. For Mac users

<p>Download the Mac installer from the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Nodes.js® web site.</a></p>
<p>Choose the LTS version that’s shown on the left</p>
<p>Run the installer (double-click on the .pkg file you downloaded in the previous step.)</p>
<p>Follow the prompts in the installer (Accept the license agreement, click the NEXT button a bunch of times and accept the default installation settings).</p>
Confirm that node has been installed successfully. You should see the version of node you have just installed.</p>

   ```sh
   node --version
   ```

2. For Windows users


## Running the app

Generate a full static production build

   ```sh
   node app.js
   ```
