ToDo List
This ToDo List is a small project I made during my web development journey, using EJS, Node, and Express.

## Installation & Set Up

<h3>Install Node.js</h3>


1. For Mac users

<li>Download the Mac installer from the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Nodes.js® web site.</a></li>
<li>Choose the LTS version that’s shown on the left</li>
<li>Run the installer (double-click on the .pkg file you downloaded in the previous step.)</li>
<li>Follow the prompts in the installer (Accept the license agreement, click the NEXT button a bunch of times and accept the default installation settings).</li>
<li>Confirm that node has been installed successfully. You should see the version of node you have just installed.</li>

   ```sh
   node --version
   ```


2. For Windows users

<li>Download the Windows installer from the  <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Nodes.js® web site. </a></li>
<li>Choose the LTS version that’s shown on the left</li>
<li>Run the installer (the .msi file you downloaded in the previous step.)</li>
<li>Follow the prompts in the installer (Accept the license agreement, click the NEXT button a bunch of times and accept the default installation settings).</li>
<li>Restart your computer. You won’t be able to run Node.js® until you restart your computer.</li>
<li>Confirm that node has been installed successfully. You should see the version of node you have just installed.</li>


   ```sh
   node --version
   ```


## Running the app

   ```sh
   node app.js
   ```
